## What does the Exploit do?

Samsung's Knox Messenger Attempts to detect root on a device and exits if yes. This project bypasses the said root detection by using [Xposed Framework](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811) to framework to hook into the app's root detection function call and return no root detected.

## How to install this exploit?

1. This application requires android version 4.0.1 or later (Android IceCreamSandwich or later - so far JellyBean, Kitkat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat)
2. Make sure you have [Xposed Framework](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811) installed and running.
3. Build this project in Android studio and install the produced apk.
You can also get the latest release of the APK from the [Xposed Module Repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/akhil.knoxrootbypass)
4. Reboot your phone.

## How to use Samsung Knox Messenger Root Bypass

No UI. Simply install, enable the module in Xposed Installer, Reboot, and done.
The very first time you start Knox Messenger after installing this, it may complain that the device is rooted but it proceeds to login none-the-less
